Assignment & Exam Creation: Set assignments and exams, upload resources, and set due dates.
Grading System: Input and review students’ grades for assignments and exams.
Communication: Send announcements to students and parents (e.g., exam schedules, assignment deadlines).
Reports: Generate student progress reports for parents or for their own record-keeping.
3. Staff Dashboard

Communication: Message teachers or staff regarding the child’s academic performance or general inquiries.
Fee Payment: View outstanding fees and pay online.
Event Calendar: Access information about upcoming school events, exams, and meetings.
5. Student Dashboard
Purpose: Students will access their academic information, assignments, and class resources.
Main Features:

Assignment Submission: Submit assignments, view deadlines, and receive feedback from teachers.
Grades Overview: Access grades for assignments, exams, and overall performance.
Resources & Materials: Download study materials or past exam papers uploaded by teachers.
Attendance Record: See their attendance status for each subject.
Communication: Receive messages from teachers or announcements from the school.
6. Mobile Responsiveness
Each dashboard should be fully responsive. Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to ensure the layouts adapt well to mobile screens.
Navigation bars, tables, and forms should adjust based on screen size to maintain a smooth user experience for users accessing the system via their mobile devices.
7. Security Considerations
Each user role must have access only to the data and actions that are appropriate for their role:
Admins should have full access to everything.
Teachers only to their own classes and students.
Parents only to their children’s information.
Students should only access their own grades and reports.
Use Django’s authentication and permission system to enforce these rules.
8. Additional Features for Consideration
Notifications: Implement a notification system for sending alerts about assignments, fees, or upcoming events.
Parent-Teacher Meetings: Allow parents to schedule meetings with teachers through the system.
SMS or Email Integration: For sending reminders or announcements to parents, teachers, or students.
Real-Time Messaging: A messaging feature where students can ask questions and teachers or admins can respond (optional, if you want to use something like Django Channels for real-time communication).
Project Steps:
User Authentication & Role Management:

Set up user registration and login, and implement role-based access control.
Use Django’s built-in user system and extend it with custom profiles for the different roles (admin, teacher, student, etc.).
Dashboard Design:

Create base templates for each type of user’s dashboard. Use Bootstrap or Tailwind for responsive design.
Make sure each user sees only their relevant sections upon logging in.
Core Features Implementation:

Implement class management, attendance, grading, and assignment submission features for teachers.
Build student-facing features for viewing schedules, grades, and submitting assignments.
Develop fee management and logistics for staff users.
Mobile-Responsive Design:

Ensure your app looks good and works well on different devices using media queries and responsive frameworks.
Testing:

Test the application across different roles to ensure that the permissions and workflows work smoothly for each user type.
